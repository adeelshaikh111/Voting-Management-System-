**Voting Management System**


This project is a console-based Voting Management System developed in C++ with a focus on efficient data handling using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Key features include:

Doubly Linked Lists: Used to manage voter data with optimized Big O complexity, facilitating efficient insertion and deletion.
Merge Sort: Ensures fast alphabetical ordering of voter names, making data retrieval quick and organized.
File Management: Enables reading and writing of data to files, ensuring persistence and easy access to stored information.

This Voting Management System provides a solid framework for managing and sorting voter information, ideal for educational purposes and as a practical example of C++ DSA implementation.
